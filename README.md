# YouCount
YouCount allows you to see the subscriber count of any YouTube user in realtime. Youtube doesn't allow you to see the subscriber count in realtime. But on YouCount, the subscriber count is updated every second!

### Website
https://youcount.github.io/

### Why does it exist?
There are other websites that allow you to do this as well, but most of them are either badly designed or are not optimized for mobile. YouCount has been specifically designed using the Material Design language and has been optimized for mobile devices.

### Features
- Shows subscription Count of a YouTube channel (updated every second).
- Shows subscribers needed to reach a milestone YouTube subscriber count (updated every second).
- Accepts usernames/YouTube URLs, Channel names, Channel IDs, or any keywords in general; It acts like a YouTube channel search engine.
- Shows suggestions for YouTube Channel names as the user types the name of channel.
- Shows additional useful information about the YouTube Channel.
- Shows a line chart which gets updated in realtime and shows the increasing/decreasing trend of the YouTube subscriber count.
- Uses Google's Material Design language guidelines without using any Material Design libraries.
- Has a responsive design, enabling it to work with almost every touch and non-touch device.
- Has been highly optimized to load very quickly.
- Has an embed feature which allows you to put YouCount on your own website.
- Is absolutely free and has been made using absolutely free stuff on the internet!

### How To Use
Click on the grey searchbox on top where the YouTube Channel's name is written and you can write the Username/ID/Channel Name/Youtube URL (all of them work!) of any channel of your choice and press Enter or the search button. In a way, this is a search engine for YouTube Channels which shows you the subscriber count of the most relevant match with what you type in, so you can type in any of the keywords relating to the channel just like in a search query.

For example, if I want to see Fine Brothers Entertainment's live subscriber count, I can click on the grey area and write any one of these:

- TheFineBros (their username)
- Fine Brothers Entertainment (their channel name)
- fine bros (a search query)

All of them would show up the realtime subscriber count of the Fine Brothers Entertainment's YouTube channel.

After the above step you'll be able to see the subscriber count that the Youtube Channel has and it is updated every second!
You can also click the red button below to check out extra useful information like the overall total views the channel has and when the YouTuber(s) will reach his/her next Subscriber milestone!
